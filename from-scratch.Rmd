# Overview

How to get restarted with R after a fresh install. 

# Install R

Download and install latest version of R [here](https://cran.r-project.org/)

```{r install-initial-packages, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("r-lib/devtools")
```

# Personalize

Set theme to Tomorrow Night Bright

Turn off options to:

* restore `.Rdata` to workspace at startup
* save workspace to `.Rdata` on exit
    
Update `.Rprofile` based on advice from [here](http://kevinushey.github.io/blog/2015/02/02/rprofile-essentials/):

```{r edit-rprofile, eval = FALSE}
usethis::edit_r_profile()
```

# Update terminal

Follow general steps described [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-configure-your-macos-terminal-with-zsh-like-a-pro-c0ab3f3c1156/)

Check that SSH agent is running

```{zsh, eval = FALSE}
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

Copy `SSH-config` to `~/.ssh/config`

Provide SSH keys to [GitHub](https://github.com/settings/keys)
